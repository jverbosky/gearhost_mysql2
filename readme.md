**GearHost MySQL2 - Ruby Methods**

Due to my 12-month free tier benefits expiring, I was looking for a DB replacement for AWS RDS (PostgreSQL) and found GearHost's MySQL service.

I decided to use the mysql2 gem and was able to get the basics working quickly, but the examples I found for parameterized queries weren't exactly comprehensive.

So I'm hoping this helps to fill in that gap, and makes the next person's life (yours?) a little easier.

For an integrated example, please see this file from my Phonebook repo:

Have fun and hope that helps!
